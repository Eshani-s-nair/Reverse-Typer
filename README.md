# TypeFlip 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: The Reverse Engineers

### Team Members

* Team Lead: \[Your Name] – \[Your College]
* Member 2: \[Name] – \[College]
* Member 3: \[Name] – \[College]

### Project Description

TypeFlip is a web-based typing challenge — but backwards!
You type sentences in reverse, with modes that mess with your brain, a timer that measures your WPM, and a scoreboard to show off your questionable talent.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People type forwards every day… BORING. Nobody challenges themselves to unlearn years of muscle memory for no reason at all.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We force you to type backwards in different, confusing ways — because we can. It’s the least productive way to “improve” your typing speed.
