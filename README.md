# TypeFlip üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: The Reverse Engineers

### Team Members

* Member 2: Eshani S Nair ‚Äì \[SOE CUSAT]

### Project Description

TypeFlip is a web-based typing challenge ‚Äî but backwards!
You type sentences in reverse, with modes that mess with your brain, a timer that measures your WPM, and a scoreboard to show off your questionable talent.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People type forwards every day‚Ä¶ BORING. Nobody challenges themselves to unlearn years of muscle memory for no reason at all.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We force you to type backwards in different, confusing ways ‚Äî because we can. It‚Äôs the least productive way to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù your typing speed.
